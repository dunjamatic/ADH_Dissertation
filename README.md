# How to Use

The user should use the code files in their specified numerical order (e.g., 1. Extract data --> 2. Create outcome data --> 3. Clean data, etc.)

# Credits
- Built by Dunja Matic with assistance from Pradeep Virdee, particularly for files in 1. Extract Data
- Files in 6. Imputation and 8. Statistical Models were adapted from code provided by van't Klooster et al. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8352343/)
- Hyperparameters in the gridsearch in 9. Machine Learning Models were based on Zhou et al.'s code (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.120.019628)
